## Ancilliary Notes

(May require cleanup)

* `V` command is much more resource intensive than having transpose done in the table.
* Longer tables are easier on the CPU.
* `O` modulation looks like pulse waveform.
* Is influenced by the width of the pulse - shortest one - best sound for hum, whereas 75% makes it sound almost inaudible.
* One of the ways to control its volume is to move around the steps where the `O` is active, where it's not, and make sure it hits those thinner waves if we want the hum to be quieter.
* `O` command may be used anywhere.
* `W` command adds overtones + hum.
* `E` is heavy on the CPU.
